# Running your first flow with Prefect, Jupyter-style!

## Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or greater
## Getting Started
We will demo some of the features of Prefect through Jupyter. To begin, 
1. Clone the repo with SSH:
```console
git clone git@github.com:serinamarie/prefect-in-jupyter-notebook.git
``` 

Alternatively, clone the repo with HTTPS:

```console
git clone https://github.com/serinamarie/prefect-in-jupyter-notebook.git
```

2. cd into the working directory
```console
cd prefect-in-jupyter-notebook
```
3. Install Jupyter Notebook
```console
pip install notebook
```

4. Once installed, start up the notebook server:
```console
jupyter notebook
```

5. Look at `prefect_ml.py` and `titanic.csv`. We will be using these in the demo.

6. Do not skip step 5. When you're ready, click `getting-started-with-prefect.ipynb`!
